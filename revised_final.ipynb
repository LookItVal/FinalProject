    "Bird species classification based on audio recordings has significant implications for ecological monitoring, biodiversity studies, and conservation efforts, as well as being applicable and interesting to a population of bird watchers and nature lovers. This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning pipeline capable of identifying bird species from basic metadata recordable by a cell phone recording. By leveraging advanced audio signal processing techniques and modern classification algorithms, the project aims to create a reliable and scalable solution for bird call recognition."
